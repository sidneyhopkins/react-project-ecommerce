# React E-commerce & Shopping Cart Project

This e-commerce shopping cart project showcases my React, JavaScript, and CSS experience. As of writing, the project is considered done. I used create-react-app to get started.

**If you want to look at the code, here's where I would start:**

1. Home (../pages/Home.jsx);

2. Navbar (../components/Navbar.jsx);

3. Cart (../components/Cart.jsx);

4. Item (../components/Item.jsx).

## Highlights

- Shopping Cart

  - Open/Close to fixed position on right side
  - Add/Remove items
  - Badge displays updated number of items
  - Price summary

- Dynamic Image Slider

- Fully Responsive

- CSS-in-JS (styled-components)
  - Material icons, badges
  - CSS Transitions
  - Media Queries

## Project Goals

- Implement a minimum viable shopping cart using React
- Create a responsive e-commerce page
- Include Material icons

Personal Goals

- Apply React knowledge and continue learning
- Practice and apply JavaScript skills
- Learn CSS-in-JS and practice CSS

## Limitations

There are many improvements I would've liked to make and functionality to add. I have chosen to move on to other projects so that I can continue to learn new things.
