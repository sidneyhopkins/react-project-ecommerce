# React E-commerce & Shopping Cart Project

This single-page e-commerce shopping cart project showcases my React, JavaScript, and CSS experience. As of writing, the project is considered done. I used create-react-app to get started.

**Where to start:**

My best work starts at the parent **Home (../pages/Home.jsx)**

Then, it's child **Navbar (../components/Navbar.jsx)**

Then, it's grandchild **Cart (../components/Cart.jsx)**

Lastly, it's great-grandchild **Item (../components/Item.jsx)**

## Highlights

- Shopping Cart

  - Open/Close to fixed position on right side
  - Add/Remove items
  - Badge displays updated number of items
  - Price summary

- Dynamic Image Slider

- Fully Responsive

- CSS-in-JS (styled-components)
  - Material icons, badges
  - CSS Transitions
  - Media Queries

## Project Goals

- Implement a minimum viable shopping cart using React
- Create a responsive e-commerce page
- Include Material icons

Personal Goals

- Apply React knowledge and continue learning
- Practice and apply JavaScript skills
- Learn CSS-in-JS and practice CSS

## Limitations

There are many improvements I would've liked to make and functionality to add, but I have chosen to move on to other projects so that I can continue to learn new things.
